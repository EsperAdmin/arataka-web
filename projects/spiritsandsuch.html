                            <hr>
                            <p>SpiritsAndSuch.lol is a port of the original re-creation of the website from the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_Psycho_100" target="_blank">Mob Psycho 100</a> by <a href="https://cabrailsford.com/" target="_blank">Cabrails Ford</a>.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I Saw that the original Wordpress website had been down for some time so I decided to take everything off from the archives on the way back machine and re-make it into an active website again! It's very simple and not
                                complicated AT ALL. I even thought maybe not to add this to this website but I figured why not. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>So, yeah, sorry but their is not much to add here. You can visit the website and take a look at it <a href="https://spiritsandsuch.lol" target="_blank">here</a>. Just keep in mind that the guest book page does
                            NOT work and you will get a little popup telling you so if you try to enter any information.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>OH! I almost forgot to say this. I added a section to the website under "Esper.lol". This is for my Mastodon instance based on Mob Psycho 100, it's really just an Instance for Anime nerds though. You can take at look
                                at it <a href="https://esper.lol/about" target="_blank">here</a> if that peaks your interest.
